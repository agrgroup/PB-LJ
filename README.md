# PB-LJ

In this code, we demonstrate the solution of the theory developed in ref. 1 to incorporate van der Waals and soft repulsive interactions into a Poisson-Boltzmann framework. There are four MATLAB codes, as documented below:

1. sigma_epsilon_fitting.m: In this code,

2. ion_wall_code.m: In this code,

3. ion_ion_code_both.m: In this code, 

4. Capacitance_NaF_Ag_111.m: In this code,
