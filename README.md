# PB-LJ

In this code, we demonstrate the solution of the theory developed in ref. 1 to incorporate van der Waals and soft repulsive interactions into a Poisson-Boltzmann framework. There are four MATLAB codes, as documented below:

1. sigma_epsilon_fitting.m: In this code, we fit the Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters for the polyatomic sulfate ion using the LJ parameters for the constituent sulfur and oxygen atoms.

2. ion_wall_code: We solve for the potential and ionic concentration profiles inside an electrical double layer (EDL) with ion-wall interactions included in the model.

3. ion_ion_code_both.m: In this code, we solve for the potential and ionic concentration profiles inside an EDL with ion-ion and ion-wall interactions included in the model.

4. Capacitance_NaF_Ag_111.m: In this code, we plot differential capacitance curves for aqueous NaF solutions in contct with a Ag(111) electrode, and compare the results with experimental data.
